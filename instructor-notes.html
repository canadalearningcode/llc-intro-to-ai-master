      ###Instructor Notes

      ###Ladies Learning Code: HTML & CSS LEVEL 2: BUILD AN ONLINE RESUME

      <br>
      ##Schedule

      <strong> Important note:</strong>
      This is a guideline, not a rule! It is more important that the learners are following along then it is to get to the end of the slides!

      <em>Please note</em>: this schedule is for a single day workshop.
      If you are leading two weekday evenings, you can split this schedule up accordingly. Please remember to take a 15-30 minute break on both days. The first 15-20 minutes of the second day should be allocated for review and questions from the prior session.

      * <strong>Intro (10:00 am - 11:00 am)</strong>: What is AI, history, why should you care, Data, exercise 1
      * <strong>Intro to Dataiku (11:00 am - 12:30 am)</strong>: What goes in a database, data types, Intro to Machine Learning, terminology and learning approaches
      * <strong>Lunch Break! (12:30 pm - 1:00 pm)</strong>
      * <strong>Data Scientists workflow (1:00 pm - 3:30 pm)</strong>: Exercises 3-5, challenges, ethical issues
      * <strong>Wrapping it up (3:30 pm - 4:00 pm)</strong> Probability vs. certainty, final exercise and closing remarks


      <br>
      ##General Notes

      **Important!** Before the class begins, update the WiFi credentials and the link on the first slide as provided by your chapter lead. (eg. `bit.ly-dataiku-aug10-toronto`)

      * Please give learners enough time to download learner files. Check in as people are entering the room to make sure they have learner files.
      	* A common issue with leaner files - make sure Windows users extract the folder. If a learner sees the slides without any styles, that is probably why.

      There will be videos used in the slides that will require audio/speakers, so ask your chapter lead or experience coordinator if this is available at your venue. Turn on closed captions on videos if they are available.
      

      Try to encourage collaboration during every exercise.

##Specific Examples<br><br>



**Slide 7: WHAT IS AI?**<br>
Ask about what words or concepts first come to mind on this topic. What do they know about the topic and what do you want to learn about today?


**Slide 9: WHAT IS AI? CONT'D**<br>
What makes a dog or a human intelligent?


**Slide 13: HISTORY OF AI: A NEW AGE?**<br>
An example of taking away the need for humans to make decisions would be in the Stock Market. Where could this potentially be dangerous? Think of Sci-Fi movies where AI created to keep humans alive may use dangerous utilitarian tactics,  eg. genocide or nuclear war.


**Slide 15: HISTORY OF AI: NOTABLE DATES**<br>
Ask what the Turing test is - can a program imitate a person?


**Slide 16: HISTORY OF AI: NOTABLE WOMEN**<br>
AI & ML needs to be open to all genders, backgrounds and demographics.<br>
It also can be used in many different applications - civil engineering, astronomy, business, economics, etc.


**Slide 18: WHY SHOULD YOU CARE?**<br>
Incorporates all of our human biases, flaws and behaviours.


**Slide 19: WHY SHOULD YOU CARE?**<br>
Invite people to contribute why they care - what needs do you have that could be solved with AI? How can we balance the needs of all nationalities, classes and demographics?


**Slide 21: WHY SHOULD YOU CARE?**<br>
If you started late you can skip these videos, but they are quick demonstrations of how AI can be used to solve real life problems like getting reliable medical advice or navigating while you drive.


**Slide 24: WHAT IS DATA**<br>
Ask the class what each of the bullet points at the bottom of this page could be collecting from you - encourage participation from multiple people.


**Slide 27: EXERCISE 1: OUR FIRST DATABASE (20 MINS)**<br>
Explain the exercise in full before they split into groups, otherwise they will start chatting and then you will have to shout over them.<br>
Split up these groups depending on the size of your class, which may very. You can do this based on rows or desks they're sitting in.


**Slide 29: CLASS EXERCISE: CREATE A CSV FILE FROM GOOGLE SHEETS**<br>
If someone creates a new column, like to include their name, you can go ahead and delete that. The data is meant to be anonymous.<br>
Ask for any quick observations once the sheet is filled out. Repeat what they said out loud if any of them are speaking quietly, in case others can't hear.<br>

Once they have finished, show them how to download as CSV. They may need help from mentors to do this. They don't need to open the spreadsheet in Excel or Numbers or any other software on their computer - we're going to use this to import into Dataiku.


**Slide 30: DATAIKU**<br>
data + haiku = dataiku


**Slide 32: ONLINE OPTION**<br>
They will need to use the link that was updated on the first slide to gain access. Give everyone enough time to login and create a new project.


**Slide 33 & 34: OFFLINE OPTION**<br>
This offline option can be used if WiFi is not available or is unreliable at your venue.


**Slide 36: WHAT GOES IN A DATABASE?**<br>
Point out the green rows on the projector for anyone who may be colourblind.


**Slide 37: DATA TYPES**<br>
If the short descriptions of the data types on the slide before were unclear, you can take more time here. Otherwise you can skip this slide. The learners can take the time to read these descriptions on their own.


**Slide 39: EXERCISE 2: EXPLORE THE DATA (15 MINUTES)**<br>
Go through this exercise slowly and talk out what you're doing when you drag items into the x & y. Invite the learners to drag & drop data items into the x & y on their own and take note of any relationships they may notice. Do all of these correlations imply causation? (Eg. people who like the colour pink spend more time watching TV). This can be a good point for discussion and how Machine Learning can make false causation assumptions if they aren't looked at critically by a human.


**Slide 40: LET'S USE DATA TO SOLVE PROBLEMS!**<br>
Can you offer incentives (like more vacation time or bonuses) to employees to keep them around longer? Bare in mind you have to be tactical in who to offer those incentives to. You could ask the learners how they would make those decisions.


**Slide 41: MACHINE LEARNING**<br>
Ask learners what they think this is and how it differs from Artificial Intelligence.


**Slide 42: WHAT IS MACHINE LEARNING?**<br>
- Make inferences or predictions based on data provided<br>
- Processing data, abstracting meaning<br>
- Acquiring new knowledge<br>
- A test may be required at the end to evaluate/verify what's correct


**Slide 43: MACHINE LEARNING IS A CORE OF AI**<br>
**Deep learning:** relates to yourself biologically, like how the brain functions using neural networks. Neurons in the brain can recognize faces around the room, or even in places where there are no faces, like in the clouds or in a rock face. Our brains are programmed to identify the general shapes of an eyes and a mouth to detect danger or allies.<br>
Deep learning builds on layers of artificial neurons to make predictions.<br>

You can show this video on how machines learn:<br>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9OHn5ZF4Uo
<br><br>
A program is only as good as the data that we feed it. Data needs to be inputted uniformly (case sensitivity). Does this apply to the spreadsheet exercise we did earlier today? Did anyone create a new row, without copying the row above, which might cause a lack of uniformity in data collection?


**Slide 44: Machine Learning Terms**<br>
**An instance** = 1 row = 1 person<br>
**Attributes** = columns<br>
The rest of the info on this slide is a little more technical and may not be necessary to fully understand for today.


**Slide 49: WHAT ARE THE TYPES OF LEARNING APPROACHES?**<br>
Reinforcement is something we interact with, like making inferences from a user's watch history on Youtube.


**Slide 59: CLASS EXERCISE CONT'D: EVALUATING THE INPUTS**<br>
When looking at the graph, relative weighting if someone is going to leave or not - what factors should we pay more or less attention to?


**Slide 60: CLASS EXERCISE CONT'D: EVALUATING THE MODEL**<br>
Make note of items that are crossed out that the model rejects


**Slide 61: CLASS EXERCISE CONT'D: EVALUATING OUR MODEL**<br>
This one can really confusing and can quickly devolve into group discussions, so try to keep everyone on track here.<br>
- **Precision recall** focuses on the correctness of predictions - false positives or false negatives<br>
- When there are subtle differences between two markers, which one do you want to prioritize? (eg. recall vs precision)


**Slide 62: UNDERSTANDING PERFORMANCE/QUALITY OBJECTIVES**<br>
People may not always answer honestly.<br>
**Error tolerance:** what's worse? Telling someone who doesn't have cancer that they have cancer, or telling someone who has cancer that they don't? This touches on the ethical issues with data modeling.


**Slide 63: EXERCISE 5: CHANGE THE TRAINING SETTINGS (10 MINS)**<br>
**Lower fitting:** introduces variations into how the model is trained. This tends to be better than having one dataset<br>
**XGBoost:** gets rid of outliers in your data. For example, if you're looking at the commuting distance from home to work for all of your employees, and 1 person's is very different from the others (everyone commutes for ~ an hour, except 1 person who lives next door).


**Slide 64: APPLYING THE MODEL TO OTHER EMPLOYEES' DATA**<br>
Q: Why is machine learning more prevalent now than it was in the past?<br>
Possible Answers:<br>
- CPU cost has reduced making processing power more easily affordable<br>
- "Big data": we have more info stored now than every before<br><br>

**Random forest**: (found in Dataiku) - many decision trees combined into 1


**Slide 65: CHALLENGES IN MACHINE LEARNING**<br>
**Overfitting:** when applied to new data sets, old predictions are not as accurate if you leave the model unchanged for too long. Tweaks and adjustments have to be made to keep things relevant.<br>
**Underfitting:** data is too random making it hard to see any patterns


**Slide 66: IMPROVING RESULTS**<br>
- Humans (data scientists) have to keep intervening to tune the model & consult with the experts in the field, like psychologists or medical doctors.<br>
- A model may have difficulty making predictions if a data set is not large enough. You can compare real data against a model to resolve this problem, but it will be flawed until the point in which more data is available.


**Slide 67: ETHICAL PROBLEMS OF AI**<br>
You can show them this video if you have time:<br>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pq-S557XQU
<br><br>
Some discussion points that arose after watching this video:<br>
- This assumes a static definition of any of these jobs<br>
- Presumes an economic (capitalist) structure - we need to work to make money, corporations want to reduce cost and maximize profit<br>
- People may shift to increasingly prioritize social interactions over convenience, eg. people who more often shopped online may prefer to go to local/small businesses and buy in person instead.


**Slide 70: PROBABILITY OR CERTAINTY?**<br>
This is an example of a Think-Pair-Share exercise. They can start by having discussions in smaller groups. Then ask each group to share 1 highlight of that discussion with the entire class. 


**Slide 73: WE DID IT!!**<br>
Now is the time to acknowledge and congratulate the learners - they should feel proud for taking the time to learn something new, push themselves out of their comfort zone and challenge themselves. If you have time to share the results from the last exercise, invite the learners to share their findings and share any new thoughts that arose from that exercise.<br>

This workshop covered A LOT of material, so feeling overwhelmed is totally expected and normal! Don't forget to acknowledge and thank the mentors at this time too!


**Slide 74: NEXT STEPS!**<br>
Get them excited about where they can go from here, whether that be through more workshops with us, independent learning, or where they can find local meet-up groups or events, online or in person.
