            Today we'll be exploring data to solve problems! 

            1. First we'll learn about databases by collecting data and entering it into our own database.
            2. We'll be given a challenge and solve it using machine learning to predict the future.
            3. We'll find our own challenge to solve.

            Some of the human activities that could be programmed using artificial intelligence include:
            
            - **Computer vision:** ability of computers to identify objects, scenes, and activities in images
            - **Natural Language Processing:** ability of computers to understand meaning from text or generating text that is readable
            - **Speech Processing:** automatically transcribing human speech or generating speech from the corresponding text

                  # History of AI: Notable Women

                  While the AI sector has been historically dominated by men, women are also making contributions to the field of Artificial Intelligence. Some of them work right here, in Canada. 
                  
                  In 2005, four women, organized the first "Women in Machine Learning Conference". The conference has now been running for over 10 years and WiML has a directory of women in Machine Learning, 1000 women strong. 

                  ![Women in ML across the world](framework/img/workshop/women-in-machine-learning.png)

  
                  ## These are just a few of the amazing women working in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence in Canada and around the world: 
                  
                  ![Nancy Reid](framework/img/workshop/nancy-reid.jpg)
                  Dr. Nancy Reid is a University Professor of Statistical Sciences at the University of Toronto. She is an Officer of the Order of Canada and the Director of the Canadian Statistical Sciences Institute. She works in statistical inference, with an emphasis on likelihood-based methods and higher order asymptotics.

                  ![Kathryn Hume](framework/img/workshop/kathryn-hume.jpg)
                  Dr. Kathryn Hume - Product management and marketing lead for Integrate.ai, a startup helping large enterprises reinvent customer engagement by applying new AI technologies.

                  ![Bonolo Mathibela](framework/img/workshop/bonolo-Mathibela.jpg)
                  Dr. Bonolo Mathibela is a Machine Learning Scientist at IBM Research Africa, where she builds machine learning models that autonomously improve road traffic flow.

                  ![Kiri Wagstaff](framework/img/workshop/kiri-wagstaff.jpg)
                  Dr. Kiri Wagstaff is a Principal Researcher in Machine Learning and Tactical Uplink Lead for the Opportunity Mars Rover (Mars Exploration Rovers) at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory. She develops machine learning methods for spacecraft and space applications.

      ## 1. Without women and underrepresented groups, AI can have terrible consequences: 

      - When Siri was first introduced into the iPhone it was not able to understand women's voices because it had not been tuned to recognize higher pitch voices which women typically have. The developers of the speech recognition engine Siri uses programmed their own biases into the algorithms - as older men they were suffering from high frequency hearing loss. This is why it's so important to employ diverse teams of software developers.
      - An AI system designed by Northpointe in the US to predict the likelihood that an alleged offender will commit another crime in the future was shown to demonstrate racial bias in its predictions.

      ## 2. We need to solve the problems of each of us, not just the loudest amongst us.

      We all need to care about being represented in the datasets and algorithms being used in AI today so that the machines that are made to help humanity, also help us.

        # Why should you care? 


        ## 3. Women stand to lose more in an automated world: 
        
        According to the World Economic Forum, "twice as many women than men are likely to lose their jobs as automation replaces human labor." This is due to the fact that most jobs that can be automated are held by women. (e.g. cashiers)

                        Data is everything. More specifically, data is information. 

                        - When we perceive the world around us, we are collecting and processing data.
                        - Data is also being collected all the time about our own actions and interactions by others
                        - Can you think of examples of when and where data about you is collected on a regular basis?
                          - stores ?
                          - government ?
                          - websites ?
                          - satellites ?

                # Structured vs Unstructured Data

                When we think of databases we're thinking of structured data. That is, data that can be neatly categorized and searched by a computer algorithm. 

                Unstructured data is a bit more messy and cannot neatly be categorized. Think for example of a **photo library**. We can now catalog our photos using advanced data markers like geo-tags, time stamps and even face recognition, but it's still very hard for a computer to really know what a photo is about.

            1. Go to the spreadsheet at: http://bit.ly/llc-ai-dataset 
            1. Go around your circle and give the Data Input Specialist the following information to enter into the spreadsheet. Be sure to only use the options listed below: 
              - Age Range: 18-29, 30-40, 40-50, 50+
              - The number of hours watching TV per week
              - The number of hours in social media per week
              - The latitude of the city you're in (Clue: if the latitude is N of the equator, just add the number. if the latitude is S of the equator, add a "-" in front of the number. Do not add letters or non-numerical symbols to this column)
              - The longitude of the city you're in (Clue: if the longitude is E of the prime meridian, just add the number. if the longitude is W of the prime meridian, add a "-" in front of the number. Do not add letters or non-numerical symbols to this column)
              - Favourite Colour

              #Database Files

                Databases can be saved in various formats.

                Today we will be using datasets saved as **CSV files** (filename.csv) . CSV stands for *Comma Separated Values* because rows of data are saved separated by commas. 

                CSV files are really useful because they enable you to easily transfer data from one program to another. 

                We’ve been using Google Sheets so far but soon we’ll want to look at our data using data analysis software and CSV is compatible with it and most similar software.

                Let's compare: 

                1. Data in our table: 
                ![starter db](framework/img/workshop/spreadsheet.png)

                2. Data in a csv file: 
                ```CSV
                Age Range,Weekly Hours of TV,Weekly Hours on Social Media,Favourite Color,Favourite Protein,Favourite Film Genre,Favourite Music Genre,Favourite Pet
                30-40,5,2,Red,Fish,Romance,Indie,Cat

          # Class Exercise: Create a CSV File From Google Sheets

          Let's create our first CSV file from the dataset we built in Google Sheets to understand this type of file a bit more. 

          1. Open up the Google Sheet at [http://bit.ly/llc-ai-dataset](http://bit.ly/llc-ai-dataset). Be sure not to tamper with any of the data in the sheet. 
          1. Go to File > Download As > Comma Separated Values
          1. Your file will begin downloading. Be sure to move your file into the **exercise-files** folder for this class. 

          Note: If needed, there is a backup CSV file with fake student data in the exercise-files folder already.

              Today we will be using Dataiku to visualize and analyze our datasets. Dataiku is a platform that enables us to analyse our data and (later), run machine learning algorithms on our data, using a friendly Graphical User Interface(GUI). If we want, it also allows us to look behind the interface at the code itself to make changes. 

              (A special shout-out to the Dataiku team for supporting us in the installation of Dataiku for every student today!)

# Online Option

To Connect to Dataiku you will need to go to the unique URL that was sent to your Instructor or Chapter Lead via e-mail. 

Then you will login using a unique username and password assigned to you based on a number. 

Your username will be **miss#** and your password will be identical to the username. 

E.G. If your assigned number is 41, Your username will be **miss41** and your password will be **miss41**

In some cases you'll notice more than one student using the same dataiku platform. For this reason be sure to save all your projects in Dataiku with your name so that you can identify them better when you work in the platform. 

If your unique URL or username and password don't work a mentor, instructor or chapter lead will help you. 

A HUGE Thanks to the team at Dataiku and in particular Joel Belafa from Dataiku who helped us set everything up for #llcCodeDay!

                  # Offline Option for Mac: Installing Dataiku on an Apple Computer (15 mins)

                  1. Wait for the USB from the instructor with offline versions of dataiku and all the software you will need.
                  1. Open the DMG file and drop the application into the Applications folder.
                  1. Open up the application by finding it with Spotlight or clicking on its icon in the Applications folder. 
                  1. You may need to authorize Dataiku to run on your OS. If so, Open System Preferences, go to "Security & Privacy" and authorize the application
                  DSS opens automatically in your browser (only Chrome and Firefox are supported). To reopen DSS, click on the DSS logo in the menubar or browse to [http://localhost:11200](localhost:11200)
                  1. Dataiku requires that you register for an account when you load up the app the first time. It's free. It may take 5-10 minutes to receive your account confirmation so this is a good time for a break.

            # Offline Option: Installing Dataiku on a Windows Computer (15 mins)

            ## For Windows computers, we’ll be using the Virtual Box option since Dataiku only runs locally on Linux and Apple computers. Get the USB from the instructor/mentor with the software you need.
            1. Move the files from the Windows Installation folder to your computer.
            1. Run the .exe file inside the folder to install Virtual Box.
            1. Import the Data Science Studio Virtual Machine from the folder into Virtualbox (either by double-clicking or using File > Import Appliance)
            1. The Appliance import wizard opens. You should not need to change any setting. Simply click on Import.
            1. Once the virtual machine is imported, click on Start. The virtual machine boots. (It's possible that this will fail and you will get an error that says a variation of `VT-x is not available...`. This is because you need to activate Virtualization from the BIOS. Please ask a mentor for help with this.)
            1. Once the Virtual Machine has finished booting, it displays a welcome banner with connection details.
            1. You do not need to login into the virtual machine. Open your regular Chrome or Firefox browser (ie: not in the virtual machine). In that browser, open the URL that is displayed in the welcome banner, as "Data Science Studio interface". The DSS interface appears. This URL to open is often http://127.0.0.1:10000 (but not always, please check the welcome banner).
            1. Dataiku requires that you register for an account when you load up the app the first time. It's free,but it may take you 10 minutes to get the confirmation e-mail if you haven't done this before. So go grab a coffee.

           # What goes in a database?

           What kinds of information can we add to a database? If information is EVERYTHING, how do we store that in a computer in a way that it will understand? 
           
           There are established **types** of data that we can define in a database. For example:

            - Integer (int, whole numbers)
            - Float (float, numbers containing decimals)
            - String (str, words, sentences, literal text)
            - Boolean (True, False)
            - Bytes and byte arrays, e.g. a jpeg image file.

          These are whole numbers (no decimals). E.g. The number of attendees that came to your party = 35.
          ## Float(float)
          These are decimal numbers. E.g. Usain Bolt’s 100m world-record-breaking running speed: 9.58 seconds.
          ## String (str)
          Strings are words, sentences or text. E.g. Your favourite colour: “Red”
          ## Booleans 
          True or False. E.g. Are you attending your friend’s wedding? Yes(True). 
          ## Bytes and byte arrays
          This datatype is used for images such as jpegs.

              # Class Exercise: Our First Dataiku Project

              Now that we have an account in Dataiku, let's import the csv file we created in Google Sheets into our first Dataiku project. 

              1. Go to the Dataiku Dashboard. 
              1. Select the plus sign on the left hand corner to create a new project. ![new project](framework/img/workshop/new-project-plus.png)
              1. Give your project a name. E.g. “My first Data project”
              ![project name](framework/img/workshop/new_project_name.png)
              1. Import your first dataset. (this is the CSV file we created in Google Sheets) ![import button](framework/img/workshop/import-first-dataset.png)
              1. There are lots of ways to import datasets. We want to click on “Upload Files” under “Files”. 
              1. Select the CSV file you created earlier in Google Sheets. You’ll be able to preview it right away.
              1. Click Create to finish the import. ![create](framework/img/workshop/create-dataset.png)
              
              Here's an animation of the process of uploading your dataset:

                  # Exercise 2: Explore the Data (15 minutes)

                  Now it’s time to explore the data! 

                  1. Once you click create, you should be sent directly the table of data with the exploration menu at the top. If not, click on the “Data sets” icon from the dashboard. 
                  1. The dataset should open and enable you to explore using the exploration menu above it. 
                  1. On the menu above it click on "Explore" ![data dashboard menu](framework/img/workshop/explore-menu.png)
                  1. In the Explore tab you can see all of your data in table format. In the top row you’ll see that every single column is first recognized as a string. This is because all CSV file values are stored as strings. Below the String you’ll see the actual data type Dataiku will recognize for each of your columns. Are they all correct? Check against the data type definitions we talked about eariler. 
                  1. Create a chart! If you go into the Charts tab you can start playing around with some data visualization! The default chart is a Histogram Bar Graph. You can change the type of graph you want by clicking on the graph-type dropdown. ![graph-dropdown](framework/img/workshop/graph-type-dropdown.png)
                  1. You’ll notice that some chart fields can only be filled with numerical columns. For instance, the Y column of your bar graph, must be a numerical data type for it to work. Play around with the columns and charts and see if there's any correlation between them! Have fun! 
                  ![show by](framework/img/workshop/X-Y-VALUES.png)
                  1. Bonus: Experiment with some of the geographical charts and your longitude and latitude columns! See if you can map everyone's favourite colour by location! 
                    1. Head on back to the explore tab to see the table again. 
                    1. From the Actions dropdown in the upper right hand corner, select Prepare again. 
                    1. In the scripts are to the left of the table, click on "Add a step".
                    1. Select the geography checkbox ![geography checkbox](framework/img/workshop/geocheckbox.png)
                    1. Select “create geopoint from lat/lon ![geopoint](framework/img/workshop/create-geo-point.png)
                    1. Fill in the longitude and latitude inputs with their respective columns and give a name to the new geopoint column. ![create geopoint](framework/img/workshop/geopoint.png)
                    1. Click on Run to run the recipes  You will be asked to drop your original data and rebuild in order not to affect your schema. Do that. 
                    1. At the bottom, a new prepared dataset will be available to click on. Go to it and explore your new data. Notice the new column for your Geo Point? Now you can create geographic maps.

                      Now that we have explored our simple database, let's work with some real data. 

                      **Problem:** The HR Department at IBM has a problem. They want to reduce the number of employees that leave the company. 

                      **Solution:** In a dream world, the HR department would like to be able to predict which employees are most likely to leave the company so that they can stop them with new incentives. 

                      How do we implement this solution? Machine learning.

                        #What is Machine Learning? 

                        Machine learning involves feeding data into a special kind of computer program, specifying a particular outcome, and having a machine develop its own algorithm to achieve the outcome. (Will Knight, July 20, 2017)
                        
                        For instance, presented with a database of information about credit card transactions, such as date, time, merchant, merchant location, price, and whether the transaction was legitimate or fraudulent, a machine learning system learns patterns that are predictive of fraud.

                        - Traditionally data goes into the computer, the algorithm does its job **and gives out the result**.
                        - Learners turn this around: in goes the data and the desired result and **out comes the model** that turns one into the other.
                        - Learners are algorithms that make models **capture decision and action rules**.
                        - They learn knowledge / process that **underlie skills**

                              ## Instance (example, case, record):
                              A single object of the world from which a model will be learned, or on which a model will be used. Instances are described by feature vectors.
                               
                              ## Attribute (field, variable, feature)
                              A quantity describing an instance. An attribute has a domain defined by the attribute type, which denotes the values that can be taken by an attribute. A feature is the specification of an attribute and its value. For example, color is an attribute. ``Color is blue'' is a feature of an example.
                              
                              The following domain types are common:
                              
                              ### Categorical
                              A finite number of discrete values. The type nominal denotes that there is no ordering between the values, such as last names and colors. The type ordinal denotes that there is an ordering, such as in an attribute taking on the values low, medium, or high.

                              ### Continuous (quantitative)
                              Commonly, subset of real numbers, where there is a measurable difference between the possible values. Integers are usually treated as continuous in practical problems.
                               
                              ## Predictions: 
                              model output that predicts the outcome by discovering patterns in the data
                               
                              ## Model: 
                              A structure and corresponding interpretation that summarizes or partially summarizes a set of data, for description or prediction. Most inductive algorithms generate models that can then be used as classifiers, as regressors, as patterns for human consumption, and/or as input to subsequent stages of the KDD process.
                               
                              ## Classification Model/ Classifier: A mathematical function that maps from unlabeled instances to (discrete) classes.
                              For example, mapping each employee at IBM to the classes of leaving the job in the next 6 months or not.
                               
                              ## Regression Model/ Regressor:
                               A mapping from unlabeled instances to a real value, such as “amount” or “weight”.

                                  - **Supervised**: Learn rules that map inputs to target outputs.
                                  - **Unsupervised**: Learn to cluster and label similar inputs.
                                  - **Deep** learn through a hierarchy of simple to complex concepts.
                                  - **Reinforcement**: Learn by continually interacting with an environment.

                                      Supervised learning happens when we feed the computer data and the outcome we want from that data. Then we let the computer find a correlation between the data and the outcome so that it may predict outcomes with new data without us providing the outcome. 

                                      For example: 

                                      1. We could give a computer a set of data about many different patients. 
                                      2. We could then tell the computer which of those patients have cancer and which ones don't. 
                                      3. The computer will find a correlation between the patients' data and whether or not they have cancer (that would be the model). 
                                      4. Then it will use this model which is no more than a mathematical function, to figure out which patients have cancer from the new dataset we give it without outcomes. 
                                      
                                      The **goal** is to minimize the error between the model's predictions and the actual outcomes.

                                      In a **perfect world** we would minimize errors on all possible inputs. 

                                      In **reality**, we usually don't have enough inputs with corresponding outcomes to teach the computer well enough.

      Imagine we gave a computer millions of images of puppies and kittens. What characteristics about each might we pick to enable a computer to learn to identify future puppies and kittens? With images it's quite hard. This is where **deep learning** comes in.

      - Deep neural networks are a subtype of supervised learning. 
      - Deep networks are multilayer networks on top of each other where each layer corresponds to a different level of abstraction.
      - There are two main reasons behind the popularity and the high impact of deep neural networks in various fields such as computer vision and speech recognition:
        - The emergence of modern parallel computing architectures providing low-cost and fast computation for a large number of parameters of the deep networks.
        - The availability of vast amounts of images, video, speech and text on the Internet providing sufficient data for training these networks.
      - Each layer in the deep architecture provides a nonlinear information processing. 
      - The output is a parameterized function of the inputs and the output of each layer is the input for the higher layer.

              In unsupervised learning we give the computer unlabeled data (Input representations without their corresponding outcomes). 

              **The hacker in the haystack:** Imagine if we wanted a computer to figure out which internet users were hackers. We likely wouldn't have enough data for supervised learning so we would instead use unsupervised learning and the computer would find clusters of users, some who could be potential hackers based on online behaviour that is different than normal.

                # Data Collection
                Collecting and preparing the INPUT and the OUTCOME are the most important steps in solving problems using machine learning

                In supervised ML, the model learns from the labeled instances that we feed into the model. The trained model can later be used to predict the outcome of data that you do not have the answer for. 

                ## Each instance in your data must contain two elements:

                - **Input** - The raw input that should be mapped to numerical values as variables/features 
                - **Outcome** – what you want your model to predict. 

                ## Sources for labeled data:

                - **Experienced data:** Historical data captured from processes with inputs and outcomes.
                - **Human Annotation:** Providing input to human annotators and ask for the labels

                    When we talk about features, we're talking about the columns of our database. 

                    The performance of machine learning models significantly depends on the representation of the data 
                        
                    Each piece of information included in the representation of the input is called a feature.

                    **Example:** Representing a patient- doctor examines the patient, measures blood pressure, body temperature, takes MRI, CT scan, blood sugar test and provides this information to an AI system as feature inputs

  # Clean, Prepare and Manipulate Data

  Pre-processing and cleaning data are important tasks that must be applied before using data to train an ML model

  Why? To avoid "garbage in, garbage out"

  ## The problems with raw data

  - Incomplete: having missing values for different attributes per records
  - Noisy: non-correct values for some attributes, outliers
  - Inconsistent


  ## Preprocessing Steps: 
  - **Data cleaning:** fill in missing values, smooth noisy data, identify or remove outliers, and resolve inconsistencies.
  - **Data integration:** using multiple databases, data cubes, or files.
  - **Data transformation:** normalization and aggregation.
  - **Data reduction:** reducing the volume but producing the same or similar analytical results.
  - **Data discretization:** part of data reduction, replacing numerical attributes with nominal ones.

                            Now, let's get back to our challenge of figuring out who might leave their job next at IBM so we can stop attrition in its tracks. 

                            1. We’re going to create another project. Click on the plus sign on the left hand side of the Dataiku dashboard. Let’s call it “Machine Learning Project”
                            1. Click on Import Dataset. From the exercise-files folder choose the IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance file. It looks like a zip file but when you upload it it will become csv. 
                            1. Click on the create button to finalize the import. 
                            1. Ensure that all of the column names have been imported properly. 
                            1. Ensure that all data types have been identified correctly. **Tip:** There is a mistake on one of the columns! Here's a clue: ![clue](framework/img/workshop/clue.png)

                              ##  A supervised machine learning model is a function that takes an input and returns an output
                                F(X)=y, where F(X) is a “good predictor” for the value of y.
                                e.g. # of years at the job might be a good predictor of attrition (whether someone will stay or leave their job)
                              ## Steps to solve a problem using ML:
                                1. Identify what the input-output pairs are.
                                2. Encode inputs and outputs.
                                3. Choose a class of ML models and experimentally find the best model

                                    ## How to evaluate the quality of a learned model?

                                    - The data is split into two subsets:
                                         1. A training and validation set used only to find the right predictor function
                                         2. A test set is used to report the prediction error of the model
                                    - These sets must be distinct!
                                    - Normally, we use 70% of the data as a training and validation set and the rest as a test set
                                    - In case of having smaller datasets, we use cross-validation

#Class Exercise Cont'd: Evaluating our Model

Now we'll explore the performance report of our model and then compare these results after changing a few key settings before training the machine again. 

- First we'll examine the classification accuracy of the predictions by observing the **Confusion Matrix**. 
  
<img src="framework/img/workshop/confusion-matrix.png" alt="confusion matrix">

The confusion matrix is going to prove very handy for us to determine which model we'll go with in the end. It enables us to see how many times the model predicted false positives and how many times false negatives. In other words, we can see in the table above that there were 25 times that the model predicted an employee would not quit their job at IBM, and 35 times that it predicted they would quit when in fact they wouldn't. 

- Then, you'll see a bar graph showing another markers of performance: **Precision**, **Recall**, **F1-Score** an **Accuracy**. Dataiku even gives us four handy definitions in the sidebar to the right. 

<img src="framework/img/workshop/perf-markers.png" alt="performance markers">

**Accuracy** is the proportion of overall correct positive and negative predictions in the sample. And while it may be tempting to use this metric to choose our model, it's not the best marker. Imagine that in our dataset 90% of all employees did not leave IBM and 10% did. And then imagine that the model predicts that 100% of the employees stayed. This would mean that model would have an accuracy of 90% which seems really good, except it would have missed every single person that actually quit IBM. So, accuracy is not the right evaluation metric in this case

**Precision** is the number of true positives divided by the total number of instances predicted as positive”. 

**Recall** gives us the proportion of "positive"  actual records correctly predicted as positive.

**F1-Score** This refers to the harmonic mean between precision and recall. Since it's a much more informative marker than accuracy, precision and recall **we're going to use this to choose our model.**

# Understanding performance/quality objectives

Recognizing that perfect performance is rarely, if ever, possible
 
Performance objectives should be defined based on the end goal for the model that you are building

For example, the goal for our HR analysis is to predict which valuable employees will leave next
and give them offers of promotion/raise or any other incentive before they find another job
 
Understanding the error tolerance is a critical step in identifying the risks in every model prediction

For example, the risk of false negatives in diagnosing cancer vs marketing recommendation engine

In our HR analysis case, to predict attrition for each employee, **which of false negative and false positive is more risky?**

<p class="delayed">That's right false negatives are more risky because there are people who will leave IBM that we wouldn't capture. </p>

# Exercise 5: Change the training settings (10 mins)

Now we'll let you change the training settings to determine which inputs and algorithms might give you the best results.

1. Go back to the Models list. 
2. Select "Settings" in the upper right hand corner.
3. Try removing any of the "features" that you have discovered are not really relevant. (e.g. Gender).
4. Go to Algorithms and enable the Random Forest algorithm and the XGBoost algorithms. Both of these will use multiple decision trees to optimize predictions. 
5. Click on Train again to run your amended algorithms.
5. Back in the Models list, select the table view
![models table](framework/img/workshop/modelstable.png)

You'll see in the table view that it's easier to compare our confusion matrix metrics, including the F1 Score that we decided we'd rely on to choose our model. 

By these metrics, XGBoost seems to be the best performing algorithm. Let's go ahead and select the XGBoost model by clicking on it. Then, select **Deploy** from the upper right hand corner above the report. 

This will take you to the workflow graph where you can see what we've done with our dataset. 

![workflow](framework/img/workshop/workflowdataiku.png)

We fed it to dataiku and it was used to train the model. If we click on the prediction (XGBOOST) model you'll see a drawer open from the right giving you the option to apply the model on data to predict.

  # Applying the model to other employees' data

  Now that we have chosen our best performing model we can start using the model in practice to predict attrition from new employee data. 

  Now we can go and ask IBM to give us employee profiles without an attrition column and have our model predict who is most likely to leave IBM and then suggest reasons for why this may be. 
  
  Before we can apply the model on new data, we'll need to import a new dataset. Go ahead and click on the +Dataset button ![+dataset](framework/img/workshop/plusdataset.png) above the workflow to import the no-attrition-column-set csv file from your exercise-files folder. 
  
  Next, return to the workflow view and let's go ahead and click on the Score cup to test our prediction model. 

  ![workflow score gif](framework/img/workshop/workflowscoregif.gif)

  Once you've run your predictions go ahead and explore the new dataset to see the three added columns with the attrition prediction and the probability associated with each guess. 

  This can be used by HR at IBM to target employees that are likely to leave and figure out how to entice them to stay. 

  You can also return to the bar graph of variables importance and make some suggestions to HR about what factors might be contributing most to attrition. For example Monthly Income, Daily Rate or No overtime. You might even want to create some chart visualizations for HR to see these correlations more clearly. 

  It will now be up to HR to start experimenting with different solutions to prevent attrition at IBM.

# Challenges in Machine Learning

## Overfitting: 

We can find a hypothesis that predicts perfectly the training data but does not generalize well to new data

- The function ”memorizes” the data points, but is wild everywhere else.
- Typical overfitting means that error on the training data is very low, but error on new instances is high


## Underfitting

- Typically, underfitting means that error on the training data is very high

# Improving Results
## Human in the Loop? 
![human in the loop](framework/img/workshop/human-in-loop.png)

If the model is not confident in any of its predictions on the instances in our dataset, e.g. the IBM employees in our set, we can ask a human to make a prediction based on his/her intuition and background information and we will add their prediction as an extra training instance to our training data.

                # Ethical problems of AI
                
                Remember the gender column in our dataset? Was that a relevant column for determining attrition of employees? What about employees that are non-binary? Where will they fall? 

                Here are a few more ethical dilemmas we need to deal with in AI

                1. Unemployment as a result of smart machines taking over jobs.
                2. Bias in Models: Racist and Sexist Models
                  - Remember all AI models have been trained by human behavioural data, so they have inherited all our values and biases
                  - A study showed that human sequential bias can be found with loan officers approving or denying loan applications.
                3. Error of the models in production
                4. Black Box Models: Non-interpretable models - this is typical in deep learning where we may not be able to understand, as humans, how the computer came to the outcome that it did.

              # Discussion! (15 minutes)

              In groups of 4 discuss the following: 
              
              ## Problem 1
              1. If tomorrow you heard that Uber's new self-driving car had crashed and killed its passengers, would you volunteer to be the next passenger? 

              1. If you answered No, would you answer change if the cost of riding in the self-driving Uber was much lower than if you ordered a human driver?

              1. If you answered No, would your answer change if you knew that human drivers have a higher probability of crashing than self-driving cars?
              
              ## Problem 2

              1. After going to the doctor, she tells you that based on your AI results, it's 60% likely that you have a deadly disease. When you ask for human confirmation of the certainty of the results, the doctor tells you the AI is much better at diagnosing diseases than she would be with old-fashioned diagnostic methods.

                  - Would you accept treatment for your disease? 
                  - Would you wait for a higher probability/more certainty before deciding on treatment?

                        # Python AI Libraries

                        There are a number of helpful Python libraries that make it easier to work with data and machine learning. Code libraries are pre-written code functions that help you quickly accomplish complicated tasks without having to write all your code from scratch. The **sklearn** library is a robust AI library that you can experiment with in the Dataiku platform.

                        # Machine Learning Steps In Python

                        So far we've worked with a Graphical User Interface on Dataiku. This is what you would have to do to accomplish the same thing using just Python code: 

                        1. Use the sklearn platform.
                        1. Load the dataset
                        1. Initial Preprocessing of the data
                        1. Create Training and Test sets
                        1. Preprocessing: Fill missing values, Handle Categorical Features, Normalize numerical Features
                        1. Choose the Classifier mode
                        1. Train a Classifier using train set
                        1. Evaluate the learned model
                        1. Make some predictions

                        This probably seems like a lot! Let's look at the code.

                        #  Jump to Jupyter Notebook and Understand the Python code
                        1. Select the best trained model in Dataiku based on the evaluation metrics for each model.
                        1. Go to Deploy>Jupyter notebook
                        1. Map each of the steps in previous slide to a cell in Jupyter notebook
                        1. Run all cells and check the output of each cell

                        # Bonus Exercise: Change the Code (20 minutes)

                        In this exercise you will manipulate the code inside Jupyter using the Python sklearn library documentation. 

                        1. Switch the Random Forest classifier model to use Logistic Regression(LR). **Hot Tip**: Refer to the [documentation](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.html)
                        2. Train and test the new model - does the result improve? 
                        3. Change the evaluation metric to have F-score. Again, use the [documentation for f-score](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.f1_score.html)
                        4. Change the parameters of the LR classifier like solver, regularization penalty, *and* inverse of regularization strength *(C),* and investigate the effect of these changes in the performance of the model.
